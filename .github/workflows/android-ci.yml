# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Android CI
#
# This workflow will:
# 1. Trigger on pushes and pull requests to the 'main' branch.
# 2. Set up a Java (JDK 17) environment AND cache Gradle.
# 3. Run the linter.
# 4. Run unit tests.
# 5. Build a debug APK.
# 6. Upload the debug APK as an artifact.

name: Android CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events that target the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # 1. Checks out your repository's code so the job can access it
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Sets up the Java JDK v17 AND enables Gradle caching
      # --- THIS IS THE NEW FIX ---
      # We are using setup-java to handle both Java and Gradle caching,
      # which avoids the 'gradle/setup-gradle' action that was failing.
      - name: Set up JDK 17 and Gradle
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: "17"
          distribution: "temurin"
          # Add this to cache Gradle dependencies
          cache: "gradle"

      # 3. Grant execute permission for gradlew
      # This is necessary because file permissions are not always preserved in git
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x gradlew

      # 4. Run the linter (checks for code quality and style issues)
      # 'lintDebug' runs the linter for the 'debug' build variant
      - name: Run Lint
        run: ./gradlew lintDebug

      # 5. Run unit tests
      # 'testDebugUnitTest' runs all local unit tests for the 'debug' build variant
      - name: Run Tests
        run: ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest

      # 6. Build the debug APK
      - name: Build Debug APK
        run: ./gradlew assembleDebug

      # 7. Upload the generated APK as a workflow artifact
      # This allows you to download the APK file directly from the GitHub Actions run page
      - name: Upload Debug APK
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: debug-apk # The name of the artifact
          path: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk # The path to the file to upload
